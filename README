A simple mineSweeper game for Linux platform. The objective of the game is to locate or reveal all the open locations. Flaging mined locations does not count in any respect to the score. Revealing all the open locations in the minimum time get the highest score. The score is calculated using the 3BV/s where 3BV is the minimum number of left clicks required to reveal the open locations on the board. More information on 3BV/s is available on this wiki page (http://www.minesweeper.info/wiki/3BV).
The code was not tested on Windows platform but can run using some modifications by editing the code in visual basic. The game will be made compatible with windows soon and a separate repository will be released.
